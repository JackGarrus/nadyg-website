# 📝 nadiaguarracino.dev

My little corner of the internet — a blog where I collect all the cool and weird things I’ve discovered as a software engineer, from web development to the occasional math or physics rabbit hole 🕳️🐇

👉 **Live here**: [https://nadiaguarracino.dev](https://nadiaguarracino.dev)

> 🖤 Built with Next.js, MDX, pure CSS and yes, there's dark mode.
