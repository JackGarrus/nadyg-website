For developers coming from the web front-end world without a computer science background,
dealing with system configurations can feel tedious, especially at the beginning.
<br />
I remember <i>hating</i> this part, deeply, until I had the ‚ú® brilliant ‚ú® idea of installing a
tool I already had, blindly trusting that everything would somehow "just work" and the system would automatically swap versions.
<br />
Spoiler: it didn‚Äôt üôÇ
I spent hours going crazy trying to fix the mess with my enviromental variables.
<br />
Eventually, things started working again... but honestly, I had no idea why they did. I hadn‚Äôt understood what I had broken, nor what I had accidentally fixed.
<br />
After that painful experience, I made myself a promise: keep an eye on the <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight>.
<br />
Months later, one random day, I ran <Highlight>echo $PATH</Highlight> just to check... and I gasped: the story was about to repeat itself:
<br />
<br />
<Image
  src="/pathDemistified/dups-in-path.png"
  alt="dups-in-path"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
<br />
But this time, I caught it early enough to avoid another descent into madness.
<br />
That‚Äôs when I decided: it was time for me to control my machine, not the other way around!
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Fist, A Basic Question: What Is $PATH?
<ul>
  <li>
    <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> is an <strong>environment variable</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    lists directories where the system looks for <strong>executable programs</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

<br />
## Why do we need it?
<ul>
  <li>
    For you, so can easily run tools from the CLI (git, node, ruby, etc)
  </li>
  <li>
    For the shell, so it can find the corresponding executable when you type a command
  </li>
</ul>

<Callout>
  Without <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight>, your terminal wouldn't know where to find git, node, ruby, brew, or anything else
</Callout>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
## How The Shell Searches For Commands
<ul>
  <li>
    The shell reads your <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight>
  </li>
  <li>
    Starts from the first directory
  </li>
  <li>
    Checks if a file matching your command name exists and is executable
  </li>
  <li>
    If found, it executes it immediately
  </li>
  <li>
    If not, it moves to the next directory
  </li>
</ul>
Here's a visual sketch of the process:
<br />
<br />
<Image
  src="/pathDemistified/shell-linear-search.png"
  alt="shell-linear-searchs"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    If no match is found, you get the infamous error:
    <Highlight>zsh: command not found: brew</Highlight>
  </li>
</ul>


Yes: the lookup for the executable is a simple <strong>linear search</strong>, and that's why:

<Callout>
   the order in which the directories appear in your <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> is important
</Callout>

<br />
And fun fact: shells like zsh cache found commands in a <strong>hash table</strong> for faster reuse.
<br />
So, basically once it has found the executable in your  <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> it won't perfom the search all over again
once you type the command. It will look into its hash table first.
<br />
Now, going back to the (beautiful)  <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> I showed you at the beginning, you can see
two times Postgresql version 15:
<br />
<br />
<Image
  src="/pathDemistified/postgres-in-path-1.png"
  alt="postgres-in-path"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "50%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
<br />
But what if eventually I would have wanted to install and use Postgresql version 16?
<br />
Then, most likely, if I wouldn't have paid attention, I would ended up having in my path:
<br />
<br />
<Image
  src="/pathDemistified/postgres-in-path-2.png"
  alt="postgres-in-path"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "50%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
<br />
 ...which brings me to the issue I described initially.
 <br />
 No thanks, I like to live an happy life. That means: time to roll up my sleeves and fix the problem for good.
<br />
<br />
<br />
 ## How To Clean Repeated Entries In $PATH

The strategy that worked for me was consisting of 6 easy steps:
<ul>
  <li>
    1 - manually remove from .zshrc file any <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> declaration for the old verisons of the tools
  </li>
  <li>
    2 - remove any other explicit <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> declaration for the tools that were not necessary (for some tools the <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> is updated in the background during the installation)
  </li>
  <li>
    3 - add at very top of the .zshrc file the command: <Highlight>typeset -U path</Highlight> and save
  </li>
</ul>

<Image
  src="/pathDemistified/typeset-u-path.png"
  alt="typeset-u-path"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>

<ul>
  <li>
    5 - close all the istances of the terminal (if you want to be extra-clean, go for a full reboot of the system)
  </li>
  <li>
    6 - reopen the terminal and run <Highlight>source ~/.zshrc</Highlight>
  </li>
  <li>
    7 - and finally run <Highlight>echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n‚Äô</Highlight>
  </li>
</ul>

Result: clean <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight>, as it was always meant to be:
<br />
<br />
<Image
  src="/pathDemistified/clean-path.png"
  alt="clean-path"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>

<br />
<br />
Veri nais. My mental health was saved and grateful.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
## Now, The Nerdy Stuff: Understanding macOS System Directories (briefly)

The main issue was fixed, but I still had a little pebble in my shoe,
 something small but important before I could really say, ‚ÄúI fully control my <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight>.‚Äù
<br />
I won't go deep into this (maybe will be covered in another article), but here's a taste:
<ul>
  <li>
    <Highlight>/bin</Highlight> and <Highlight>/sbin</Highlight> contain essential binaries needed for macOS to boot
  </li>
  <li>
    <Highlight>/usr/bin</Highlight> and <Highlight>/usr/sbin</Highlight> have everyday system tools you use without even realizing
  </li>
  <li>
    <Highlight>/usr/local/bin</Highlight> and <Highlight>/opt/homebrew/bin</Highlight> are where your custom-installed stuff usually ends up
  </li>
</ul>

If <Highlight>/bin</Highlight> or <Highlight>/sbin</Highlight> vanish, your Mac won‚Äôt even boot.
<br />
If <Highlight>/usr/bin</Highlight> or <Highlight>/usr/sbin</Highlight> disappear,
  macOS will boot...  but good luck using it normally.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
## TL;DR

<ul>
  <li>
    <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> is an environment variable listing where executables live
  </li>
  <li>
    The shell searches the <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> **linearly** to find commands
  </li>
  <li>
    The **first** match wins
  </li>
  <li>
    Duplicates don't hurt performance badly, but keeping <Highlight>$PATH</Highlight> clean avoids weird version conflicts.
  </li>
  <li>
    System directories (<Highlight>/bin</Highlight>, <Highlight>/sbin</Highlight>, <Highlight>/usr/sbin</Highlight>) are there so macOS and your terminal work properly; leave them alone!
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
