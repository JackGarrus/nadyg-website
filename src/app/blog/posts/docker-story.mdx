## The Docker Engine

<br />
<br />

Under the hood, Docker is made up of two daemons — background processes that interact
with the system:

- dockerd – listens for Docker API requests and manages objects like images, containers, volumes, and networks.

- containerd – handles only the container lifecycle, with a lower-level interface.

As containers became more widely adopted, Docker decided to extract containerd from its ecosystem and make it usable as a standalone runtime — without requiring full commitment to the Docker stack.

<br />
<br />

That’s when Kubernetes and many other modern cloud platforms entered the scene.

<br />

## Docker Inc: Where’s the Money?

<br />

When Docker donated containerd to the CNCF, it was a smart community move — and it quickly became the industry standard.

But here’s the catch:
Docker Inc. is a for-profit company.
And now it wasn’t making any money from either dockerd or containerd.

So… how was it surviving?

➡️ By selling Docker Desktop.

<br />

## Kubernetes Enters the Picture

<br />

Kubernetes didn’t want to depend on Docker.

It was even developing its own runtime: CRI-O, meant to replace containerd.
But by then, containerd was already mature and widely adopted by major players like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and IBM.

So, to survive:

Kubernetes surrendered to containerd.

Docker donated containerd to survive.

Ironically, Docker ended up making its container creation model the global standard, even if the rest of its stack was being phased out.

<br />
<br />
<br />
## Docker Hub: The Hidden Pillar

<br />

Here’s the twist:
containerd relies on images created in the Docker format.

➡️ And the biggest image registry in the world?
Docker Hub, of course — hosting millions of downloadable images.

<br />

## Colima: Docker Without Docker Desktop

<br />
“Wait… if I’m using dockerd + containerd, why would I need Colima?”

Great question.

Colima doesn’t replace the Docker engine — it replaces Docker Desktop.

It gives you:

a working dockerd + containerd environment

without paying for Docker Desktop

and works on macOS via a lightweight Linux VM (Lima)

So:

<Image src="/colima-does.png" width={600} height={200} alt="colima does" />

<br />

In brief:

<Image src="/colima-is.png" width={600} height={350} alt="colima is" />
<br />
<br />

## Why Docker Runs Natively on Linux

<br />
Because Linux already has everything Docker needs built-in:

cgroups

namespaces

container-friendly file systems

→ Docker runs directly on the OS.
→ No VM required.

On macOS and Windows, though, a VM is necessary — like Docker Desktop or Colima.

## TL;DR

containerd is now the industry standard container runtime.

Docker Inc. makes money from Docker Desktop, not the daemons.

Kubernetes adopted containerd because it was already widespread.

Docker Hub is still the central container image registry.

Colima is a free alternative to Docker Desktop on macOS.

On Linux, Docker runs natively — no VM required.
