## Quick intro
What pushed me to write this article? One word: Colima.
<br />
At some point, we had to uninstall Docker Desktop at work and start using Colima via the CLI, but I never really understood why.
<br />For a while, I just went along with it.
Then one day, I decided to dig into how our app’s dev environment actually starts up. The first command I run starts colima, followed by <Highlight>docker compose -up</Highlight>.
And that got me thinking:
 <strong>if we don’t have Docker Desktop anymore, why are we still running Docker commands?</strong>
 <br />
So… what is Colima, <i>really</i>? And that’s how this whole investigation started, which I am going to share with you now.
<br />
<br />
## The Basics: The Docker Engine

<br />
<br />
<br />
First, let's have a quick overview of what the Docker engine consists of.
<br />
Under the hood, Docker is made up of <strong>two daemons</strong> (background processes
that interact with the system):

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>dockerd</strong>: listens for Docker API requests and manages
    objects like images, containers, volumes, and networks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>containerd</strong>: handles only the container lifecycle, with a
    lower-level interface.
  </li>
</ul>

Originally, <Highlight>containerd</Highlight> was just a component within Docker, but as containers became more widely adopted, things got complicated, especially when Kubernetes entered the picture.

<br />
<br />
## Kubernetes Didn't Want Docker

Originally, Kubernetes only worked with Docker, but over time, people wanted to use different runtimes (like <Highlight>containerd</Highlight> standalone, etc.).
So the Kubernetes team created <strong>CRI</strong>, so it could support any runtime, as long as it followed this standard interface.

<Callout>
  <strong>CRI</strong> (Container Runtime Interface): API that tells Kube how to
  talk to a container runtime
</Callout>

<br />

On top of that, <strong>dockerd</strong> was doing way more then Kube needed, like handling volumes, networks, image builds, and logs.
that's why at a certain point the Kubernetes team decided to build something simpler: a lightweight runtime made just for Kubernetes, called <strong>CRI-O</strong>

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Docker Inc. Strategy

At that point, Docker Inc. realised something important: “We're not going to make money from <Highlight>dockerd</Highlight> or <Highlight>containerd</Highlight>, but we can make money from developer tools!”

<br />
So in 2017, Docker made a bold move.

It:

<ul>
  <li>
    open-sourced <Highlight>containerd</Highlight>
  </li>
  <li>
    donated it to the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)
  </li>
  <li>
    refocused on Docker Desktop and Docker Hub
  </li>
</ul>

But the strategy didn't stop there. <strong>Docker also decided to open-source dockerd</strong> by moving it into the <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby" target="blank" style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}><strong>Moby project</strong></a>,an official open-source project by Docker to <i>"to enable and accelerate software containerization"</i>.

<br />

Smart play. After all, <Highlight>containerd</Highlight> runs Docker images, ...and where are most of those stored? On Docker Hub!

<br />
Now the ecosystem could adopt <Highlight>containerd</Highlight> freely, and Docker could monetize its dev tools (and yes, Docker still uses <Highlight>containerd</Highlight> internally as part of dockerd. That hasn't change).

<br />

<Callout>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>containerd</strong>: used by Kubernetes, cloud, CI/CD; is industry standard
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>dockerd</strong>: used by Docker CLI, Colima, dev env; is <i>NOT</i>  industry standard
    </li>
  </ul>
</Callout>
<br />
<br />

## Kubernetes surrenders to containerd

Once <Highlight>containerd</Highlight> became an open-source standalone runtime, Kubernetes had to adopt it.

<br />
Why?
<br />

<Highlight>containerd</Highlight> became the most widely adopted container runtime in Kubernetes clusters, major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM...) all adopted it.

<br />

<Highlight>CRI-O</Highlight> remained a valid alternative, but <Highlight>containerd</Highlight> won the popularity contest.

<br />
Kube didn’t drop <Highlight>CRI</Highlight>. It still uses it, but now it talks to <Highlight>containerd</Highlight> directly using a CRI plugin, rather than going through <Highlight>dockerd</Highlight>.

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Enter Colima

While this corporate beef was going on, most devs were still using Docker Desktop on MacOS to run containers locally and they were happy.
<br />
But happiness is an ephemeral emotion, easily disrupted, and in the most cases the disruption is caused by money:
<strong>Docker Inc. started charging for Docker Desktop</strong> in some cases, and developers  started looking for alternatives because they love free stuff.

<br />

That’s when Colima came in to save the day (and the devs' happiness).

<br />
<br />
<br />

## What Is Colima?


Colima is  <strong>a free, open-source replacement for Docker Desktop.</strong>
<br />

It doesn't replace the Docker engine itself, instead, it:

<ul>
  <li>
    provides a working <Highlight>dockerd + containerd</Highlight> environment
  </li>
  <li>
    runs inside a lightweight Linux VM (via Lima)
  </li>
  <li>
    works beautifully on macOS
  </li>
</ul>

Is CLI-based, fast, and ideal for devs who don’t need a GUI.

<br />
So basically, Colima gives you a fully Docker-compatible setup, without Docker Desktop, without the licensing restrictions but still using the <Highlight>docker</Highlight>'s commands.

<br />
<Callout>
  So, we've got the answer:
  <strong>Colima</strong> doesn’t replace the Docker engine: it replaces
  <strong>Docker Desktop</strong>.
</Callout>

## Fun-fact: Docker Runs Natively on Linux

Of course it does. How could it not!
<br />

Linux already has everything Docker needs built-in: cgroups, namespaces, container-friendly file systems...

<br />

Plus, <strong>Docker runs directly on the OS</strong>, that means that <strong>no VM required!</strong>

On the other hand though, on MacOS and Windows, a VM is necessary, therefore you need to install
Docker Desktop or Colima or something else.

<br />
<br />
<br />

## TL;DR

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>dockerd</ strong> is open-source, lives in the Moby project, and is still used by Docker
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>containerd</strong> is also open-source but is not in Docker's hands anymore
    now and is the industry standard container runtime.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Docker Inc.</strong> makes money from
    <strong>Docker Desktop</strong>, not the daemons
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Kubernetes</strong> adopted containerd because it was already
    widespread
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Docker Hub</strong> is still the central container image registry
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Colima</strong> is a free alternative to Docker Desktop on macOS
  </li>
  <li>
    On <strong>Linux</strong>, Docker runs <strong>natively</strong> as no VM
    required
  </li>
</ul>
