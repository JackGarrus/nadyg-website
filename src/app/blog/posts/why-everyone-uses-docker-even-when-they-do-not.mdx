## The Docker Engine

<Image src="/docker-engine.png" width={400} height={350} alt="Docker Engine" />

Under the hood, Docker is made up of <strong>two daemons</strong> (background processes that interact with the system):

<br />

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>dockerd</strong> – listens for Docker API requests and manages
    objects like images, containers, volumes, and networks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>containerd</strong> – handles only the container lifecycle, with a
    lower-level interface.
  </li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />

As containers became more widely adopted, Docker decided to extract <strong>containerd</strong> from its ecosystem and make it usable as a <strong>standalone runtime</strong> — without requiring full commitment to the Docker stack.

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

That’s when Kubernetes and many other modern cloud platforms entered the scene.

<br />
<br />

## Docker Inc: Where’s the Money?

When Docker <strong>donated containerd</strong> to the CNCF, it was a smart community move, and it quickly became the industry standard.

But here’s the catch: Docker Inc. is a for-profit company (duh), but it isn't making any money from either dockerd or containerd.

So… how was it surviving?

...<strong>By selling Docker Desktop!</strong>

<br />
<br />

## Kubernetes Enters the Picture

Kubernetes didn’t want to depend on Docker.

It was even developing its own runtime: <strong>CRI-O</strong>, meant to replace <strong>containerd</strong>.
But by then, <strong>containerd</strong> was already mature and widely adopted by major players like <strong>AWS, Google Cloud, Azure</strong>, and <strong>IBM</strong>.

So, to survive:

<ul>
  <li>
    Kubernetes <strong>surrendered</strong> to containerd
  </li>
  <li>
    Docker<strong>donated</strong> containerd to survive
  </li>
</ul>

Ironically, Docker ended up making its <strong>container creation model</strong>
the global standard, even if the rest of its stack was being phased out.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Docker Hub: The Hidden Pillar

Here’s the twist:

<strong>containerd</strong> relies on images created in the
<strong>Docker format</strong>.

...And guess what is the biggest image registry in the world?

<strong>Docker Hub</strong>!

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Colima: Docker Without Docker Desktop

<blockquote>
  “Wait… if I’m using dockerd + containerd, why would I need Colima?”
</blockquote>

Great question. Also, becuase I have asked it (modestly).

<Callout>
  <strong>Colima</strong> doesn’t replace the Docker engine: it replaces
  <strong>Docker Desktop</strong>.
</Callout>

It gives you:

<ul>
  <li>
    a working <strong>dockerd + containerd</strong> environment
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>without paying</strong> for Docker Desktop
  </li>
  <li>
    and works on <strong>macOS via a lightweight Linux VM</strong> (Lima)
  </li>
</ul>

So:

<br />
<br />
<br />

<Image src="/colima-does.png" width={600} height={200} alt="colima does" />

<br />
<br />
<br />

In brief:

<br />
<br />

## Why Docker Runs Natively on Linux

Because Linux already has everything Docker needs built-in:

cgroups, namespaces, container-friendly file systems...

Plus, <strong>Docker runs directly on the OS</strong>, that means that <strong>no VM required!</strong>

On the other hand though, on MacOS and Windows, a VM is necessary, therefore you need to install
Docker Desktop or Colima or something else.

<br />
<br />
<br />

## TL;DR

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>containerd</strong> is now the <strong>industry standard</strong>{" "}
    container runtime.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Docker Inc.</strong> makes money from{" "}
    <strong>Docker Desktop</strong>, not the daemons.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Kubernetes</strong> adopted containerd because it was already
    widespread.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Docker Hub</strong> is still the central container image registry.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Colima</strong> is a free alternative to Docker Desktop on macOS.
  </li>
  <li>
    On <strong>Linux</strong>, Docker runs <strong>natively</strong> as no VM
    required.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
