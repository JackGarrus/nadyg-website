 ## Why this topic is important
Understanding the phases of the JavaScript engine is essential to fully grasp how
scope works (we talk about it here link) and why certain errors appear at specific times.

The process can be divided into 4 main phases:

<ul>
  <li>
    Phase 1: Parsing
  </li>
  <li>
    Phase 2: Compiling
  </li>
  <li>
    Phase 3: Execution
  </li>
  <li>
    Phase 4: Optimization
  </li>
</ul>
<br />

/>
<br />
<br />
<br />

 ## 1. Parsing
In this phase, the **source code** is read by the engine.
<br />
If there are syntax errors, they are immediately raised as **SyntaxError**.
<br />
If the parsing succeeds, a tree structure called **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** is generated,
which hierarchically represents the code and will be used during execution to establish the order of operations.

<br />
<Callout>
  When you think of a **SyntaxError**, think of the **Parsing** phase
</Callout>
<br />
<br />
<br />

 ## 2. Compiling
In this phase:
<ul>
  <li>
      **Hoisting** of variable, function, and class declarations takes place
  </li>
  <li>
    The **scope** of each variable is determined
  </li>
  <li>
    The **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** is managed for variables declared with <Highlight>let</Highlight> and <Highlight>const</Highlight>
  </li>
</ul>

(we will talk about hoisting and TDZ in the article on Scope here (link))
<br />
<br />
<br />

 ## 3. Execution
This is the phase where the JavaScript program is **actually executed** according to the instructions provided by the AST.
<br />
Here runtime errors can occur, such as:
<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    **ReferenceError** (when accessing variables that are not defined)
  </li>
  <li>
    **TypeError** (when a value is used incorrectly, for example calling something as a function that is not).
  </li>
</ul>
<br />

<Callout>
  When you think of **ReferenceError** or **TypeError**, think of the **Execution** phase
</Callout>
<br />
<br />
<br />

 ## 4. Optimization

 In the final phase, the engine tries to run the program as efficiently as possible,
optimizing performance based on the resources available on the operating system and hardware.
Of course, the topic is more complex than this, and we may cover it in a future article.

<br />
<br />
<br />

 ## When do transpiling and bundling come into play?

In reality, modern development does not stop here. JavaScript applications often go through a series of **external tools** even before the code reaches the engine:
<br />

<ul>
  <li>
      **Transpiler** (like Babel, TypeScript compiler <Highlight>tsc</Highlight>)
  </li>
  <li>
    **Bundler** (like Webpack or Vite)
  </li>
  <li>
    **Additional languages and syntaxes** (TypeScript, JSX, etc.)
  </li>
</ul>
<br />

These tools, as we know, make the code **compatible** with different environments and browser versions,
make writing more **productive** and maintainable, and produce a final optimized JavaScript ready to be processed by the engine.
<br />
<Callout>
  Transpiling happens **before** the engine starts Parsing.
  It is therefore a blocking process: without it, the engine cannot even begin.
</Callout>

<br />
<br />
<br />

 ## The Correct Order
The correct order for running a JS program is:
<br />
**Transpiling (external tools) → Parsing → Compiling → Execution → Optimization**
<br />
<br />
