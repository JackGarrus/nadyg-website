 ## Why this topic is important
The concept of scope is one of the most crucial in JavaScript, and in programming in general.
Yet, it’s also one of the most common sources of confusion.

<br />
<br />
<br />

## What is scope?
 In simple, simple terms, scope defines:

<ul>
  <li>
    The **lifetime** of a variable
  </li>
  <li>
    **Where** it lives
  </li>
  <li>
    **Where** it’s accessible from
  </li>
</ul>
That's really it. And in more simpler terms, they are of four types:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<Image
  src="/jsScope/four-scopes.png"
  alt="four-scopes"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
Let's see them in detail.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## 1. Global Scope
The global scope refers to the <Highlight>window</Highlight> object (in browsers).
<br />
Everything declared here is available throughout the entire JavaScript application.
<br />
While convenient, this can easily become problematic in large applications, which is why, over time, new ways to handle variable lifetime were introduced.
<br />
Global scope still exists today, but modern JS provides better alternatives.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## 2. Block Scope
Introduced with **ES6**, block scope is defined by curly braces <Highlight>{}</Highlight>.
<br />
Variables declared with <Highlight>let</Highlight> and <Highlight>const</Highlight> inside a block exist **only** within that block.
<br />
For example, loops (<Highlight>for</Highlight>, <Highlight>while</Highlight>) and conditionals (<Highlight>if</Highlight>) also create their own block scope.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## 3. Function Scope
Variables declared within a function are accessible **only** during that function’s execution.
<br />
Before ES6 modules, function scope was heavily used to prevent **polluting the global scope**, often through **IIFEs** (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).
<br />
<br />
<br />

## 4. Lexical Scope
Not really separate from the previous types, as it is intrinsic of each one of them, as it's also known as the **scope chain**.
<br />
Functions in JavaScript remember the **lexical environment** in which they were defined, not where they’re called.
<br />
This concept forms the foundation of **closures**, which we’ll explore in a future article.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Scope Chain
When you use a variable, the JavaScript engine searches for its declaration starting in the **current scope**.
<br />
If it doesn’t find it there, it looks in the **outer scope**, then the next one up, and so on, until it reaches the **global scope** (the <Highlight>window</Highlight> object in browsers).
<br />
If the variable isn’t found even there, JavaScript throws a <Highlight>ReferenceError</Highlight>, or, in some cases with older constructs like <Highlight>var</Highlight>, sets it to <Highlight>undefined</Highlight>.

  alt="first-scope"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
<br />
<Image
  src="/jsScope/var-in-global-scope.png"
  alt="var-in-global-scope"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
<br />
<Image
  src="/jsScope/var-undefined.png"
  alt="var-undefined"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Hoisting
During the compilation phase, the JavaScript engine moves all variable declarations (not initializations) to the top of their scope.
<br />
<Image
  src="/jsScope/hoisting.png"
  alt="hoisting"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
<br />
Here, the declaration of <Highlight>a</Highlight> is hoisted, but not its value.
<br />
If you try to access a variable before it’s declared with <Highlight>var</Highlight>, you get <Highlight>undefined</Highlight>.
<br />
With <Highlight>let</Highlight> or <Highlight>const</Highlight>, things work differently, leading us to the next topic.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## The Temporary Dead Zone (TDZ)
The **Temporary Dead Zone (TDZ)** is the time between a variable’s **declaration** and its **initialization**, the moment the JavaScript engine allocates memory for it but before it assigns a value.
<br />
Accessing a variable in this period throws a <Highlight>ReferenceError</Highlight>.
<br />
<Image
  src="/jsScope/tdz.png"
  alt="tdz"
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
<br />
<br />
Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

<ul>
  <li>
    **1** - During the **compilation phase**, the JS engine knows that <Highlight>a</Highlight> exists (it’s hoisted)
  </li>
  <li>
    **2** - But it doesn’t assign it a value yet, it’s in the “dead zone”
  </li>
  <li>
    **3** - Only when the line <Highlight>let a = 3</Highlight> is executed does the variable leave the TDZ and become accessible
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />


## Why the TDZ exists
The TDZ prevents common bugs and unpredictable behavior that were possible with <Highlight>var</Highlight>.
<br />
Before ES6, variables declared with <Highlight>var</Highlight> were hoisted and **initialized to <Highlight>undefined</Highlight>**, even before their declaration line, often leading to confusing results.
<br />
This could cause subtle logical errors in large codebases.
<br />
<Highlight>let</Highlight> and <Highlight>const</Highlight> fixed that by ensuring variables can’t be accessed before initialization, making the language **more predictable and safer**.
<br />
To summarize:
<ul>
  <li>
    TDZ **starts** from the beginning of the scope where the variable is declared
  </li>
  <li>
    TDZ **ends** when the declaration line is executed
  </li>
  <li>
    Accessing a variable in the TDZ results in a **ReferenceError**, not <Highlight>undefined</Highlight>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <Highlight>let</Highlight> and <Highlight>const</Highlight> are still hoisted, but without initialization.
  </li>

</ul>
