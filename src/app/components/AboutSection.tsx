      <p>
        I have been building for the web since 2019, and my current stack
        includes React, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL.

        In this blog, I share what I learn, practical experiences, real-world
        solutions, and interesting resources related to web development.

      <p>
        This is a space to document my journey â€” and hopefully help other
